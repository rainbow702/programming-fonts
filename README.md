Best fonts for programming

1. Aurulent: my favorite font, it looks like written by Lamy-pen, add missing glyphs from fira code;
2. Fira Code 1.206: medium as bold. You can get italic style from [github.com/zwaldowski/Fira](https://github.com/zwaldowski/Fira/tree/zwaldowski/mod-new);
3. Consolas: hinted,a better version for Win 7;
4. Liberation Mono: it has 2700+ glyphs, version 2.00.3 is last version has vertical "l";
5. Droid Sans Mono: Android official monospace font, it is most legible font for reading IMO, so use it for long reading;
6. Source Code Pro: medium as regular, the medium looks like written by art fountain pen, the official default hint is really beautiful.
7. M+ font: cool font for terminal, download from [here](https://zh.osdn.net/frs/redir.php?m=tuna&f=mplus-fonts%2F62344%2F063-WITHOUT_KANA_AND_KANJI.tar.xz)
